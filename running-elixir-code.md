## How to Run Elixir Code?

There are two main ways of running elixir code:

#### -> "elixir script.exs"

When running with "elixir", the script will be compiled and executed as it is.

#### -> "iex script.exs"

When running with "iex", the script will be compiled and you'll have a interactive option to test your implementation as you wish.
